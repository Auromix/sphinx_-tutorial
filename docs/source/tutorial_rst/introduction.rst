Overview of Sphinx
----------------------------------

Sphinx is a powerful documentation generation tool, initially developed for the Python community to build Python documentation but now widely used for various programming languages and complex project documentation. Sphinx is especially effective for large-scale projects requiring features like multi-language support, cross-referencing, and structured organization.

Key Features of Sphinx
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. **Automated Documentation Generation**: Parses code comments, particularly Python docstrings, to automatically generate API documentation.
2. **Multiple Output Formats**: Outputs to formats like HTML, LaTeX (for PDF), and EPUB.
3. **Extensive Extensions and Plugins**: Provides plugins for indexing, mathematical notation, charts, code highlighting, and custom extensions.
4. **Multi-Language Support**: Allows easy internationalization and localization, enabling multi-language documentation.
5. **Cross-Project Referencing**: Facilitates cross-referencing across documents and code, making it ideal for structured, large-scale projects.

Sphinx is commonly used for generating API documentation, software manuals, tutorials, and knowledge bases. By writing reStructuredText files and using Sphinxâ€™s tools, you can create structured and comprehensive documentation for your projects.


Use Sphinx in Your Project
--------------------------

If you need to set up Sphinx for your own project, follow these steps:

1. **Create a `docs` directory** in your project root to house the Sphinx project files.

   .. code-block:: bash

       cd <YOUR_PROJECT_ROOT_DIR>
       sphinx-quickstart docs

   This initializes a basic Sphinx project structure.

2. **Build the Documentation**

   After configuring the `.rst` files, run the following command in the `docs` folder:

   .. code-block:: bash

       make html

   This will generate HTML documentation in the `_build/html` directory.
