Paragraphs
==========

In reStructuredText (reST), paragraphs are the fundamental elements of a document. To create a paragraph, simply write the text without any special formatting.

However, to distinguish one paragraph from another, make sure there is a blank line between them.


Each paragraph is treated as a separate block of text, and reST will automatically format it accordingly.

Basic Usage
-----------------------------

.. code-block:: rst

    This is the content of the first paragraph. It can contain multiple sentences and still be part of the same block of text.

    This is the content of the second paragraph. It is separated from the first paragraph by a blank line.
